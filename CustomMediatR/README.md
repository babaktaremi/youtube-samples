## Write your own MediatR in C#
I think most .NET developers already use or at least know about the MediatR Nuget package. It's an in-process messaging with no dependencies and supports request/response, commands, and notifications. Really cool Nuget library.

But have you thought about how MediatR works?

As I'm curious to know how things work, here I try to show the gist of MediatR and how to write your own one from scratch in C#.

The main idea is simple you need to create some instances of your handler at `runtime`.

Hope you like and nice to have your feedback as well.
