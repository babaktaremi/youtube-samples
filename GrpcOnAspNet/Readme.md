# gRPC on ASP.NET

gRPC, which stands for "General Remote Procedure Call" is a high-performance RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework that was developed by Google. It builds upon the foundation of Protocol Buffers (protobuf) and leverages the capabilities of HTTP/2.0 to provide a powerful and efficient communication protocol for building distributed systems.

Some developers think the 'g' in gRPC is referring to Google but it's not:)

It is the best choice for back-to-back communication. Still, you can't use gRPC on a browser but there is a workaround for using gRPC on the web called grpc-web, it's not on stable version.

In this video, I show you how to gRPC in microservice-like architecture using API -> gRPC.SDK -> gRPC.Server.

Hope you like it.
